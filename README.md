# The Depths of Khazad-dûm

Welcome to The Depths of Khazad-dûm, a text-based dungeon exploration game set in the vast underground kingdom of Khazad-dum, inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's Mines of Moria.
(This project is currently just me running through the bracket-lib tutorial, I'll put my own work in later)

## Overview

The Depths of Khazad-dûm is an ongoing project aimed at creating a roguelike game that captures the atmosphere and adventure of exploring the depths of Khazad-dum.
